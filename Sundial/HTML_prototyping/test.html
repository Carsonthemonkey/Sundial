    <h1>Test page</h1>
    <p>Here is a test paragraph. There really isn't that much here, except, oh my! what is that? could it be a time?
        8:00 pm Eastern. Well enough of that. I need some more text.</p>
    <p>Here is a test of some formatting things:
        <span class="original-time" display="none">8:00 pm Eastern</span>
        <span class="time-replace">
            5:00
        </span>
        Anyways, now we may continue as normal.
